# RTL-Coffee-Maker-Design

An RTL design of a coffee vending machine controller using Verilog with testbench simulation.

## Files
- `coffee_making.v` – Main Verilog module (RTL code)
- `coffee_making_tb.v` – Testbench for simulating coffee-making scenarios

## Features
- Supports multiple coffee options (milk/sugar variants)
- FSM-style control logic with reset and start inputs
- Testbench verifies behavior with `$display` outputs

## How to Run
1. Open the project in a Verilog simulator like Vivado, ModelSim, or EDA Playground.
2. Compile and run the `coffee_making_tb.v` testbench.
3. Observe the console messages and waveforms for output verification.
